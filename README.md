# ResyGrabber - Restaurant Reservation Bot

This is an open-source tool to help manage restaurant reservations on Resy.com. It was previously a SaaS product but has been converted to a locally runnable application with no authentication required. This is the first SAAS product that I've released and it was very fun to work on! I am open sourcing this now though because New York passed laws making it illegal to sell dinner reservations.

## Features

- Create and manage reservation tasks
- Use proxies to avoid IP blocks
- Schedule tasks to run at specific times
- Automatically book reservations when they become available
- Bypass captchas by using an undocumented/deprecated API endpoint

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resybot-open.git
cd resybot-open
```

2. Install the dependencies for both client and server:

```
cd client
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Simple Start (Recommended)

To start both the server and client with a single command:

```
python start.py
```

This will launch both the server and client components automatically.

### Manual Start

Alternatively, you can start each component separately:

1. Start the Server:

```
cd server
python server.py
```

2. Start the Client (in a separate terminal):

```
cd client
python entry.py
```

The client will launch a menu-driven interface where you can:

- Add and manage reservation tasks
- Configure proxies
- Manage Resy.com accounts
- View and cancel existing reservations
- Schedule and run tasks

## Configuration

### Adding Resy.com Accounts

1. From the main menu, select "4) Manage Accounts"
2. Follow the prompts to add your Resy.com account information
   - You'll need your Auth Token and Payment ID from Resy.com

### Adding Proxies (Optional but Recommended)

1. From the main menu, select "2) Proxies"
2. Add your proxy information to avoid IP rate limits

### Creating Tasks

1. From the main menu, select "1) Show tasks"
2. Select "a) Add task"
3. Follow the prompts to create a new reservation task

### Running Tasks

1. From the main menu, select "7) Start Tasks"

## Open Source Changes

This project was previously a SaaS product with the following licensing/authentication requirements:

- Required a valid license key through Whop
- Client connected to a remote server hosted on Railway
- HWID validation to prevent license key sharing

The following changes were made to open source the project:

- Removed all licensing and authentication requirements
- Configured the client to connect to a local server instead of the remote server
- Added a simple startup script to run both client and server with one command
- Updated documentation with clear instructions for local usage
